A [webtrees](https://webtrees.net/) module that gives the native Android app **[wtAnd](https://github.com/thobgg/app4webtrees)**
a JSON interface for reading **and** writing. It is an ordinary custom module: it lives in
`modules_v4/`, the webtrees core is not modified.

**Why:** whoever maintains the tree at the PC keeps working in webtrees as before. The rest of the family, who so far
only had a website that is hard to use on a phone, get the tree on phone and tablet through the app: tree,
relationships, anniversaries and photos. Changes made in the app, such as a photo of a gravestone or a corrected date,
arrive as pending changes in the same webtrees installation.

| | |
| - | - |
| webtrees | 2.2.x (tested with 2.2.6); prepared for 2.3 |
| PHP | 8.3 or newer (as required by webtrees 2.2) |
| Access | read and write, always with the rights of the signed-in webtrees user |
| License | GPL-3.0 |

## The app: wtAnd

The module is the server side of **[wtAnd](https://github.com/thobgg/app4webtrees)**, a native Android app
(Kotlin, no WebView) for phone and tablet. [Download the APK](https://github.com/thobgg/app4webtrees/releases/latest)
(signed). Outside the Play Store, Android asks once to allow your browser to install apps.

| Tablet: tree and profile side by side | Phone: the profile as a timeline |
| - | - |
| ![Tree and profile side by side](docs/app-tablet.png) | ![Profile on a phone](docs/app-handy.png) |

- **Tree:** hourglass view with ancestors, partners, children and grandchildren, siblings on request;
  pan and zoom freely, unfold branches upwards, make any person the centre.
- **Profile:** a timeline of the person's life (with marriage and the births of the children), the relationship to
  yourself (“paternal grandfather”), photos, family, a map of where the person lived.
- **Editing:** add, change and delete events, add relatives with the “+” on any card, take or pick photos and attach
  them to a person, resized to fit the server's upload limit.
- **Anniversaries** of the coming days, with a daily reminder if you like; moderators accept or reject pending changes in the app.
- **Connect with one tap:** the “App” page in webtrees hands server, tree and a one-time code to the app.

German and English; the labels of the server come in the language of the app. Whatever is not native yet opens as a
webtrees page in the same session. All pictures show the fictional demo tree “Familie Falkenrath”.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Unpack it into `modules_v4/` of your webtrees installation, so that you get `modules_v4/api4webtrees/module.php`.
3. Done. The module is active and listed under *Control panel → Modules → All modules*.

Coming from version 1.2.0 or older: **delete the old `modules_v4/webtreesand-api` folder**, it was renamed in 1.3.0.
The module's address changed with it (`_api4webtrees_` instead of `_webtreesand-api_`); wtAnd 1.7 or newer handles both,
and the module takes over its settings from the old name on first run (1.3.2).

To update, replace the folder. To uninstall, delete it. The module creates no database tables. It stores
one module setting (which trees the app may reach) and, per user, only the hash of a pairing code while it is valid.

## Settings

*Control panel → Modules → All modules → api4webtrees → wrench icon* (tip: type “API” into the search box of the
module list). The page offers the app download, the status (https, upload limit) and the most important switch:
**which family trees the app may reach.** Trees that are not ticked cannot be reached through this module at all,
for any user, whatever their rights in webtrees. Default: all trees.

**Apps:** the apps the module knows (wtAnd, wtWin, wtTux, wtMac, webtrees mobile for iPhone and iPad, and any added by pull request), each with a tick. Unticked apps
disappear from the “App” page, the note and the footer. Default: all on. See [Apps on the “App” page](#apps-on-the-app-page).

![Settings page: install the app, family trees for the app, apps, status](docs/einstellungen.png)

## For users: the “App” page

Signed-in users see a note at the top of the page with a button to the “App” page – at a Windows or Linux PC
**“The family tree as a program on your PC”** (wtWin/wtTux), on a phone **“The family tree on your phone”** (wtAnd).
Phone and PC are remembered separately: the note disappears for that kind of device once its app is connected (or when
they click *Do not show again*); after that the links in the footer lead there. The page shows the apps for the
visitor's device first (own apps before others); only that app is open, the rest is folded to one line each below, so the page stays short. On an iPhone or iPad it
shows webtrees mobile by Andreas Scharf (App Store); a device without a matching app gets a note recommending the
browser. Each app has two steps:

1. **Install:** a button to the newest download (`.exe`, `.deb` or APK), for the phone also as a QR code.
2. **Connect your account – nothing to type, the password never reaches the device:**
   - **PC:** the button *Connect with wtWin* puts the connect link with a one-time code on the clipboard and opens it
     as `wtwin://connect?…` (`wttux://` on Linux). wtWin/wtTux (from 1.21) take it from the clipboard while they wait
     for a connection, or receive it from the browser – they register themselves for their scheme at first start,
     without admin rights. They ask once for confirmation, then the tree opens. If the page is older than the code,
     it reloads by itself when you come back to it (e.g. after download and installation).
   - **Phone:** one tap, or at a computer a QR code for the phone camera.
   - By hand, *Copy address* is still there: the programs fill it in by themselves, then sign in with username and password.

The one-time code is shown only to the signed-in user, is valid for 10 minutes and exactly once, and is only offered over
https – or over http inside the home network (private addresses, `.local`, `.lan`, `.fritz.box` …), the same rule by which
the apps accept http. Only its hash is stored. Do not untick the module under *Control panel → Modules → Footers*: in
webtrees that switches off the whole module, including the API.

## Privacy and permissions

The module deliberately has no login and no permission system of its own:

- The app signs in with the normal webtrees login; every request runs as that user.
- Data is read only through the webtrees objects (`canShow()`, `facts()`, `children()` …). The same
  privacy rules apply as on the web pages: living individuals appear as “Private” to visitors,
  restricted facts are left out, trees that require a login stay invisible.
- Data is written only through webtrees' own functions (`createFact`, `updateFact`,
  `createIndividual`, `createFamily`, `MediaFileService`). Editor rights, `RESN locked`, the change
  log and moderation (“pending changes”) therefore work exactly as in the web interface. Every POST
  passes webtrees' CSRF check.

## Behind SSO or password protection

If a sign-in sits in front of webtrees (Authelia, Authentik, oauth2-proxy, Cloudflare Access, basic auth), the app
cannot get through and says so. Two ways out, nothing to change in this module, which never runs before that sign-in:

- **Password protection of the web server** (basic auth, `.htaccess`/`.htpasswd`, the browser shows a small sign-in box):
  wtAnd, wtWin and wtTux from 1.38 take the user name and password under “directory protection” on their address
  screen and send them with every request to that server.
- **SSO services:** in the sign-in service, let through only requests whose `route` contains `_api4webtrees_`,
  `media-thumbnail` or `media-download`, not the whole site. The webtrees login still protects everything behind it.
  Then connect the app via the “App” page: you sign in through SSO in the browser, and the app needs no password.

## One media folder per tree

If several trees are used by different groups of people, give each tree its **own media folder**
(*Control panel → Family trees → Preferences → Media folder*, e.g. `media/smith/`). This is a webtrees
matter, not one of this module: webtrees offers editors all files of the tree's media folder that the tree
does not use yet (“unused files”). With a shared folder, editors of one tree can see and link the files
of another.

## For developers

Complete reference of all routes, answer schemas and performance figures: **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)** (machine-readable: [docs/openapi.json](docs/openapi.json), generated from real answers and checked by the tests).

### Addresses

The module uses webtrees' built-in module route and registers no routes of its own (the routing API
changes in webtrees 2.3, the module route does not):

```
<base>/index.php?route=<path>/module/_api4webtrees_/<Action>[/<tree>]&<parameters>
```

`<path>` is the path part of the base URL: `/webtrees` for `https://example.org/webtrees`, empty for
an installation in the web root. webtrees expects the sub-folder **inside the `route` parameter**;
without it the answer is a 302 to the home page or a 404. With “pretty URLs” switched on, webtrees
redirects to `<base>/module/_api4webtrees_/<Action>/<tree>?…`; the `index.php?route=` form always
works, so a client need not know the setting.

Every action accepts `lang=<language tag>` (`de`, `de-DE`, `en-GB`, …): labels, dates and relationship names
of that answer come in this language if it is active in webtrees – otherwise in the language of the session.

Rules for clients:

- A response counts only if it is `Content-Type: application/json`. Anything else means “sign in”
  (302 / HTML) or “webtrees or the web server failed” (4xx/5xx).
- Use an honest `User-Agent` and always send `Accept-Language`. A client that claims to be
  Chrome/Firefox/Safari but has no cookie yet gets a “cookie check” (406) from webtrees' bot blocker.
- Do **not** send `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`: webtrees then answers its own errors with
  `200` and an HTML fragment.
- Domain errors come as **HTTP 200** with `{"ok":false,"error":"not-found","status":404}` (`status`
  is the intended code). Reason: many web servers (Synology Web Station, nginx with
  `fastcgi_intercept_errors`) replace the body of 4xx/5xx answers with their own error page.

### Signing in

1. `GET …/Info` – sets the session cookie and returns `csrf`
2. `POST <base>/index.php?route=<path>/login` with `username`, `password`, `_csrf`
   (webtrees rejects a login POST that carries no cookie yet)
3. `GET …/Info` – `user.loggedIn` tells whether it worked

Image addresses (`thumb`, `file`) are webtrees' signed media routes and need the same cookie. `path` (level 9) is the
file's path inside the tree's media folder, for naming the same file to another module; `null` for media linked by URL.

### Compatibility

The interface is complete since level 30 (1.18): every route needed for everyday genealogy work is there, and releases are
rare from now on – changes and fixes are collected, pull requests are merged without an immediate release.

The interface only grows. Every release that adds routes or fields raises the **API level** (`apiVersion` in `Info`,
40 today); existing routes, parameters and fields keep their names, types and meaning. A client built for level N works
with every module from level N on, and an older client keeps working with a newer module – it simply does not see
the new fields. New fields are optional, so clients should ignore what they do not know. The tests check every answer
against the documented schema, so a field cannot disappear unnoticed. Where a limit is raised (generations, page
sizes), the answer reports what was actually delivered. Should something ever have to change incompatibly, it would
be a new route, never a changed one.

### Apps on the “App” page

Any client can use the interface with the normal sign-in above – nothing in the JSON endpoints, rights or privacy is
specific to one app. The “App” page, the “Connect” page, the note and the footer show the apps listed in
`src/Apps.php`. To add an app, send a pull request with one entry: name, author, kind (phone or PC), devices, download
addresses (https), the URL scheme for one-tap connecting, for a store link the store badge under `resources/img` and,
optionally, the app's logo under `resources/img` (`icon`, square PNG or SVG, shown before the name on the “App” and “Connect” pages).
Conditions: the app is publicly installable (store or release), it accepts the connect link below, and its store
description or README says that the app needs the api4webtrees module on the server, with a link to this repository. The tests reject
entries with missing fields, non-https links or a scheme already taken. Managers can untick any app in the settings.

The contract for one-tap connecting is the one wtAnd uses:

1. The “App” page and the “Connect” page open `<scheme>://connect?url=<base URL>&code=<48 hex>&tree=<tree name>&user=<user name>`
   in the app. `tree` and `user` are hints for the display; `url` is the webtrees base URL.
2. The app calls `GET <url>…/Info` to obtain a session cookie and the `csrf` token, then `POST …/Pair` with header
   `X-CSRF-TOKEN` and body `{"code": "<code>"}` – like every other POST. Answer: `{"ok":true,"tree":"…","user":"…"}` – the session
   is now signed in as that user – or `{"ok":false,"error":"pair-invalid"|"pair-expired"}`.
3. The rules for the code are those [above](#for-users-the-app-page), whichever app redeems it.

### Reading (GET)

Every person in an answer comes as the same short form: `xref`, `name`, `sortName`, `given`, `surname`, `sex`,
`isDead`, `private`, `lifespan`, `birth` and `death` (`{date, place}` or `null`), `thumb`, `url`, and from level 14
`call` (call name: the given name marked with `*` or `_RUFNAME`, else empty), `chr` (christening, `CHR` or else
`BAPM`), `buri` (burial, `BURI` or else `CREM`) – both like `birth` – and `occupation` (the first `OCCU`, or `null`).
For people the user may not see, all of these stay empty.

Every fact (`facts[]` in `Individual`, `Family`, `Export`) carries `id`, `tag`, `label`, `known`, `value`, `type`,
`date`, `place`, `notes` (strings) and `sources` (citations, complete from level 18). **Level 19 adds, per fact:**
`typeLabel` (the `TYPE` as webtrees shows it, e.g. `CIVIL` → “Civil marriage” for `MARR`; `null` without a type),
`noteKinds` (parallel to `notes`: `note` or `associates`), `associates` (people linked with `2 _ASSO`: godparents,
witnesses … – `xref`, `name`, `sex`, `rela` as in the file, `role` normalised to `godparent`, `witness` or `other`,
`label` as webtrees shows it by the linked person's sex, `private`, `level1`, `notes`, `sources`) and
`freeAssociates` (people without a record: first from the GEDCOM-L tags `2 _GODP` under `CHR`/`BAPM` and `2 _WITN`
under `MARR`, one person per line, then from notes beginning with `Paten:`, `Taufpaten:`,
`Gevattern:`, `Trauzeugen:` or `Zeugen:` – entries separated by `;`; `name` up to the first comma, `detail` the rest. A
note without `;` (the older comma-only form) gives a single entry with `name: null` and the whole `text`, no guessing). A `1 ASSO` on the person stays a fact `ASSO`
as before and, for a godparent, is added to the christening's `associates` with `level1: true`. A linked person the
user may not see comes with `private: true` and no name; one whose name they may not see is left out.

| Action | Tree | Parameters | Content |
| - | - | - | - |
| `Info` | – | – | versions, `api` level, user, visible trees with role, rights, number of individuals and (for moderators) of records with pending changes, `maxUpload` in bytes, CSRF token, `trees[].lastChange` (number of the latest change in the tree: a different value than last time means “reload”; compare for equality only, a new GEDCOM import resets it) |
| `Individuals` | yes | `q`, `page`, `scope?` | people by sort name, 50 per page, `nextPage`. `q` searches names; with `scope=all` every word must appear somewhere in the person's visible facts (`Huber Wien` finds the Hubers with Wien as birth place, residence …); error `too-many-results` when webtrees refuses the search |
| `Individual` | yes | `xref`, `relativeTo?` | person, facts (`known: false` marks vendor tags webtrees has no definition for), parent and spouse families, `stepFamilies` (the parents' families with other partners, i.e. half-siblings; `parent` names the shared parent), media, `relationship` to `relativeTo` (default: the user's own record), e.g. “great-grandmother”. Each fact date carries `gedcom` (`"ABT 1850"`) next to the display `text`, for pre-filling an edit form; each media entry carries `factId`, `primary` (the photo webtrees shows for the person) and `crop` (the GEDCOM 7 crop of this link, `{top, left, height, width}` in pixels, or `null`). The person and everyone in these families carry `hasParents`, `partnersCount`, `childrenCount`. Level 19: `associatedIn` – where this person is a godparent, witness … (the other person's or family's event with `record`, `recordType`, `name`, `tag`, `label`, `factId`, `date`, `place`, `rela`, `role`, `label2`, `level1`, `url`, for families `husband` and `wife` as xrefs of the visible partners; only visible records and facts, sorted by date) |
| `Family` | yes | `xref` | family with facts, children, media |
| `Pedigree` | yes | `xref`, `generations` (1–12, before 1.9.0: 1–7), `siblings?` | ancestors with ahnentafel number `n`; `hasParents` tells a client that the branch can be expanded further. With `siblings=1` (level 15) each ancestor carries `siblings`: the other children of the parents' family shown above it (no half-siblings), as short persons |
| `Descendants` | yes | `xref`, `generations` (1–10, before 1.8.0: 1–4) | descendants as a tree |
| `Relationship` | yes | `xref1`, `xref2`, `ancestors?` | level 13: how the two are related, like webtrees' relationship chart. `paths`: the shortest paths (at most 5, `more` if there are further ones of the same length; with pedigree collapse there are several). Each path has `name` (what `xref2` is to `xref1`, e.g. “great-aunt”), `commonAncestors` (xrefs at the top of the path: the parents of the family where it turns, a single person on a half-sibling line or when one is the other's ancestor; empty when the path goes through a spouse) and `steps` from `xref1` to `xref2`: `{person, relation, family}` with `relation` what this person is to the previous one: `father`, `mother`, `parent`, `son`, `daughter`, `child`, `husband`, `wife`, `spouse`, `brother`, `sister`, `sibling` (`null` on the first step). `ancestors=1` searches via common ancestors only; the tree setting “ancestors only” always applies. Privacy as in the chart: error `chart-disabled` if the chart is not available to the user, `private` if one of the two may not be shown (unless the tree shows private relationships, webtrees' default); people on the way appear as “Private” |
| `Export` | yes | `page` | level 17: the whole tree as far as the user may see it, for lists and books. First all individuals, then all families, 250 records per page, `nextPage`; `total` gives the number of individuals and families for a progress bar (a page may hold fewer when records are hidden). Individuals: the short form plus `famc`, `fams` (family xrefs), `facts` and `media` as in `Individual`. Families: `xref`, `private`, `husband`, `wife`, `children` (xrefs), `marriage`, `facts`, `media`. Links come from webtrees itself: with the tree setting “show private relationships” (webtrees' default) hidden people and families appear as placeholders with `private: true` and no facts or media, as in the charts; without it they are left out. `lastChange` as in `Info`: if it changes between pages, start again |
| `Pending` | yes | – | moderators only: records with pending changes (`new`, `changed`, `deleted`), who changed them and when |
| `Bookmarks` | yes | – | the signed-in user's bookmark list for this tree (persons); stored as a user preference per tree, level 11 |
| `Anniversaries` | yes | `days` (1–60, default 14) | births, marriages and deaths whose anniversary falls into the next days, with the number of years |
| `MediaObject` | yes | `xref` | one media object with its files and everyone linked to it, each with `factId` and the `crop` of their link – who is marked where on a photo; `canEdit` |
| `Portrait` | yes | `xref`, `crop?` | the main photo of the person as a square thumbnail of their crop (`2 CROP` at their link) – the image itself, not JSON; `thumb` points here when that link has a crop |
| `MediaList` | yes | `page` | all media objects of the tree, newest first, 60 per page, each with up to three linked people |
| `Tags` | yes | `type` (`INDI`/`FAM`) | labelled list of facts a client can offer for adding |
| `Places` | yes | `q` | editors only: up to 20 place names of the tree for suggestions while typing; `Wien, Ö` searches per level, like webtrees' own autocomplete |

### Writing (POST)

Header `X-CSRF-TOKEN: <csrf from Info>`, JSON body. Answer: `{"ok":true,"xref":"…","pending":true|false}` –
`pending` means the change waits for a moderator (users without “automatically accept changes”).

| Action | Parameters | Body |
| - | - | - |
| `Fact` | `xref` | `{factId?, tag, value?, date?, place?, note?}` or `{factId?, gedcom}` – with `factId` the fact is changed; sub-lines that are not mentioned (sources, media, coordinates) are kept |
| `DeleteFact` | `xref` | `{factId}` |
| `AddIndividual` | – | `{relation: child\|spouse\|father\|mother\|none, relativeTo?, family?, given, surname, sex, birthDate?, birthPlace?, dead?, deathDate?, deathPlace?, marriageDate?, marriagePlace?, facts?}` – `facts` is a list of further facts in the form of `Fact` (`[{tag:"OCCU", value:"Gardener"}, …]`), stored in the same step as the person; if one is invalid, nothing is created |
| `Accept`, `Reject` | `xref?` | – moderators only: accept or reject the pending changes of one record, or of the whole tree when `xref` is omitted; answer `{ok, pending}` |
| `DeleteRecord` | `xref` | – deletes the record with webtrees' own logic: links from other records are removed, a family left with one member and no events is deleted too |
| `Link` | – | `{individual, relation: child\|spouse\|father\|mother, relativeTo, family?, marriageDate?, marriagePlace?}` – links two existing people like `AddIndividual` does with a new one: `individual` becomes child, spouse, father or mother of `relativeTo`; `link-exists` if they are already linked that way |
| `Unlink` | – | `{family, individual}` – removes the person from the family; both records stay |
| `Media` | `xref` | `multipart/form-data`: `file`, `title?`, `note?` – uploads and links; the file is stored under the SHA-1 of its content directly in the tree's media folder |
| `UnlinkMedia` | `xref` | `{media}` – removes the link to the media object; the media object and its file stay |
| `MediaRotate` | `xref` (media) | `{quarterTurns: 1 \| 2 \| 3}` – turns the image file clockwise and the crops of all links to it along, so every marked frame stays on its face |
| `MediaCrop` | `xref` | `{media, crop: {top, left, height, width} \| null}` – sets the GEDCOM 7 crop (`2 CROP`, pixels) of the link to the media object: the part of the image that shows this person; links the media object first if needed, `null` removes the crop. The file stays unchanged |
| `PrimaryMedia` | `xref` | `{media}` – makes this the person's main photo by moving its link before all other media links. While the change is pending, a further edit of the same person restores the old order (webtrees keeps the order of the accepted record; its own “re-order media” page behaves the same) |

Dates in GEDCOM format (`12 MAR 1890`, `ABT 1850`, `BET 1900 AND 1910`). Error codes: `not-found`, `chart-disabled`, `link-not-found`, `link-exists`, `invalid-relation`, `too-many-results`,
`private`, `not-editable`, `not-editor`, `fact-locked`, `family-locked`, `fact-not-found`,
`invalid-date`, `invalid-gedcom` (only one level-1 line, sub-lines 2–9 with a valid tag), `invalid-value` (text of the form `@X@` would be a pointer), `invalid-name` (surname between exactly two slashes), `link-tag-not-allowed`, `parent-exists`, `family-required`,
`family-not-found`, `name-required`, `upload-not-allowed`, `upload-failed`.

Not included yet: creating sources and repositories, merging records.

in which file under `src/`.
